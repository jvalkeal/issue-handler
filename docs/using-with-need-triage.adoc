# Triage New Issues

In a project new issues comes and goes, some created by project trusted members
and we don't want to bug then about their issues. For community members outside
of a team we want to give a label to issues for core team to make sure that
eventually that new issue will get "triaged", aka handled in terms of doing
someting about it.

What about if you just create a new recipe to mark new issue, which is
an event `issues`, has an action type `opened`, don't have any milestones
nor labels.

config: >
  {
    "recipes": [
      {
        "name": "Mark new issue to get triaged",
        "type": "ifThen",
        "if": "isEvent('issues') && isAction('opened') && !isMilestone() && !hasLabels()",
        "then": "labelIssue(['status/need-triage'])"
      },
    ]
  }
